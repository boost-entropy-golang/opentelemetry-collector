  The import path for the extension modules can now be accessed directly:
  - `go.opentelemetry.io/collector/extension/ballastextension`
  - `go.opentelemetry.io/collector/extension/zpagesextension`
  
  If using one of these extensions, modify your Collector builder configuration to use `gomod` directly, such as:
  - `gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/extension/ballastextension v0.64.0`
