subtext: This change has currently no effect, as `basic` and `normal` verbosity share the same behavior. This might change in the future though, with the `normal` verbosity being more verbose than it currently is (see https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/7806). This is why we are changing the default to `basic`, which is expected to stay at the current level of verbosity (one line per batch).

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
