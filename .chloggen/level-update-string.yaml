note: Update values returned by `Level.String` and `Level.MarshalText` method.
issues: [6490]
subtext: |
  - All returned strings are capitalized.
  - "" is returned for integers that are out of Level enum range.
  - It also affects `Level.Marshal` output, but it's not a problem because `Unmarshal` method accepts strings in
  all cases, e.g. "normal", "Normal" and "NORMAL".
