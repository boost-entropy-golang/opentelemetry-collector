  This is addressing an issue w/ the names of the metrics generated by the Collector for its
  internal metrics. Note that this change only impacts users that emit telemetry using OTLP, which
  is currently still in experimental support. The prometheus metrics already replaced `/` with `_`
  and they will do the same with `_`.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
