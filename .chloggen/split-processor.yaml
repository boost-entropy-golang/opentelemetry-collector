  The import path for the processor modules can now be access directly:
  - `go.opentelemetry.io/collector/processor/batchprocessor`
  - `go.opentelemetry.io/collector/processor/memorylimiter`
  
  If using this processor, modify your Collector builder configuration to use `gomod` directly, such as:
  - `gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/processor/batchprocessor v0.64.0`
