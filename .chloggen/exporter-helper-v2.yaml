  The following experimental API is introduced in exporter/exporterhelper package:
    - `NewLogsRequestExporter`: a new exporter helper for logs.
    - `NewMetricsRequestExporter`: a new exporter helper for metrics.
    - `NewTracesRequestExporter`: a new exporter helper for traces.
    - `Request`: an interface for client-defined requests.
    - `RequestItemsCounter`: an optional interface for counting the number of items in a Request.
    - `LogsConverter`: an interface for converting plog.Logs to Request.
    - `MetricsConverter`: an interface for converting pmetric.Metrics to Request.
    - `TracesConverter`: an interface for converting ptrace.Traces to Request.
    All the new APIs are intended to be used by exporters that need to operate over client-provided requests instead of pdata.
