subtext: We switched back to our compression logic for zstd when a CVE was found on the third-party library we were using. Now that the third-party library has been fixed, we can revert to that one. For end-users, this has no practical effect. The reproducers for the CVE were tested against this patch, confirming we are not reintroducing the bugs.

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.

# Default: '[user]'
