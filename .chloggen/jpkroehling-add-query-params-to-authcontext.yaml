note: Auth data type signature has changed
subtext: | 
  As part of the linked PR, the `auth` attribute was moved from `configauth.Authentication` 
  to a new `AuthConfig`, which contains a `configauth.Authentication`. For end-users, this
  is a non-breaking change. For users of the API, create a new AuthConfig using the
  `configauth.Authentication` instance that was being used before.
