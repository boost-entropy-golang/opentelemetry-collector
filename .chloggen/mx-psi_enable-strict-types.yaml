  This feature gate changes the following:
  - Configurations relying on the implicit type casting behaviors listed on [#9532](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9532) will start to fail.
  - Configurations using URI expansion (i.e. `field: ${env:ENV}`) for string-typed fields will use the value passed in `ENV` verbatim without intermediate type casting.

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
