  1. Ensure an error message is logged every time and only once when data is dropped/rejected due to export failure.
  2. Update the wording. Specifically, don't use "dropped" term when an error is reported back to the pipeline.
     Keep the "dropped" wording for failures happened after the enabled queue.
  3. Properly report any error reported by a queue. For example, a persistent storage error must be reported as a storage error, not as "queue overflow".
