  - Connectors connect pipelines by acting as an exporter in one or more pipelines and simultaneously
  as a receiver of corresponding data in one or more other pipelines. For example:
    - The `forward` connector can export data to another pipeline of the same type. This allows you
    to merge data from multiple pipelines onto a common pipeline. Or, you can replicate data onto multiple
    pipelines so that it may be processed in different ways and/or exported to different backends.
    - The `count` connector can count data of any type. Regardless of the type of data that is counted, it
    emits counts as metrics onto a metrics pipeline.
  - Connectors are currently disabled by default but can be enabled with the `service.connectors` feature gate.
  - See the [connectors README](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/connector/README.md)
  for more details on how to use connectors.
