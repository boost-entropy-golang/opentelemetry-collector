  The no-op tracer provider supported by the SDK incurs a memory cost of propagating the context no matter
  what. This is not needed if tracing is not enabled in the Collector. This implementation of the no-op tracer
  provider removes the need to allocate memory when tracing is disabled.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
